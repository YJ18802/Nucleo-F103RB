# Nucleo-F103RB
driver library from scratch in embedded C for stm32f103 microcontroller

Implementation of  driver libraries to configure Nucleo-F103RB registers and 
implement various API's like read from pin, write to pin, interrupt control,commuincation protocol ,etc. from scratch in embedded C using stm32 cube ide.
The implementation is in progress , will be updating the project.
Here is the drive link for video demonstration of the example code.
